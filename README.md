**Model Score:**

* **Cross_validation_accuracy** score on previously unseen data of **0.845%**.
* **Cross_validation_percision** score on previously unseen data of **0.820%**.
* **Cross_validation_f1** score on previously unseen data of **0.867%**.

## BullDozer Price Predection 

Build a regression model using machine learning that is based on the bulldozer's previous sales history to determine how much it is worth.

**Type:** Time-Series Classification

**Dataset Source:** [**Kaggle Competetion**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)
