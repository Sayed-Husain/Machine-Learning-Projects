# Machine-Learning-Projects
Repo containing different Machine Learning Projects that I have made.

> Note that this repo is dedicated for normal Machine Learning Projects and not deep learning projects, for Deep Learning Projects, please find: 
* [**Image-Classification-Projects**](https://github.com/Sayed-Husain/Image-Classification-Projects) For Computer Vision and Image classification projects
* [**Natural-language-processing-Projects**](https://github.com/Sayed-Husain/Natural-Language-Processing-Projects) For Natural language processing (NLP) projects
* [**Time-Series-Projects**](https://github.com/Sayed-Husain/Time-Series-Projects) For All Time-Series-related projects. 


## Heart Disease Detection

Machine learning classification model to determine whether a patient has heart disease or not, based on their health parameters and heart measurements.

**Type:** Classification

**Dataset Source:** [**UCI**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)

**Model Score:**

* **Cross_validation_accuracy** score on previously unseen data of **0.845%**.
* **Cross_validation_percision** score on previously unseen data of **0.820%**.
* **Cross_validation_f1** score on previously unseen data of **0.867%**.

## BullDozer Price Predection 

Build a regression model using machine learning that is based on the bulldozer's previous sales history to determine how much it is worth.

**Type:** Time-Series Classification

**Dataset Source:** [**Kaggle Competetion**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)

## Disaster Tweets
Given Tweets, the model(s) shall detect emerginces/disasters and predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one's aren't.

In this notebook, we are going to bulid:

0. A traditional Machine Learning Model.
1. Simple Deep Learning Model.
2. Deep Learning model using Transfer learning.

**Data Source**: 
* [**Kaggle competition: Disaster_Tweets**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started)

**Problem Type**: 
* **Text Classification**
